** Corrected (bash) cleaning block
It was removing more older archives than it should.

*** 01/12
Two problems fixed:
1. The code was deleting previous major ("macro") archives  when creating new one.
2. During creation of new macro N-archive (having indices N-0-0) the code /was/ removing all /previous/ macro archives with indices M-*-* (where M=N-1).
   Now when a new macro N-archive is created, only archives with indices M-*-* (where M=N-2) except for M-0-0 are erased.
   (There was a similar problem with meso-archives which is also fixed.)

** Should be safe to use
